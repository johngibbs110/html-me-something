        <h1>Road Trip!</h1>
        <p>In the summer of 2018, Cassie and I decided to leave our home of six years and move across the country.</p>

    <h2>San Francisco, CA</h2>
        <p>Our journey began in San Francisco. No, that's not our home below, just a snapshot of some classic row houses in the Bay.</p>

    <h2>Los Angeles, CA</h2>
        <p>We went staight down the 5 to stay in L.A. for a couple of nights. We splurged on a hotel in Koreatown, ate some great tacos, and saw some weird sculpture art near Venice Beach.</p>

                <img src = "images/IMG_0198.JPG" alt = "View of the Hollywood Hills." height = 302.4 width = 403.2>

    <h2>Las Vegas, NV</h2>
        <p>Next stop was Vegas, where it was triple digit degrees. My brother-in-law repelled down from the Stratosphere and I found some crack pie.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0209.JPG" alt = "Hooch gets ready to jump." height = 403.2 width = 302.4>

    <h2>Flagstaff, AZ</h2>
        <p>The higher altitude and cooler temperature of Flagstaff brought much relief to everyone in the Green Machine. On our way into town, we made a brief pitstop at the Grand Canyon.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0752.JPG" alt = "Taking in the sights." height = 403.2 width = 302.4>

    <h2>Santa Fe, NM</h2>        
        <p>After a quick lunch in Albuquerque at Garcia's, we made our way to Santa Fe. The architecture, walkability, and food was divine.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0260.JPG" alt = "The gang on our way to breakfast." height = 302.4 width = 403.2>

            </figure>
    <h2>Denver, CO</h2>
        <p>We continued north to Denver, where we linked up with some friends who took us to a Rockies game. Brad left his jacket and keys in his seat, so security let us in after hours to go look for it (to no avail). This is a snapshot of Coors Stadium after dark.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0277.JPG" alt = "Go Rockies!" height = 302.4 width = 403.2>

    <h2>Kansas City, MO</h2>
        <p>The drive across the Great Plains nearly did us in, and we were in desperate need of replenishment once we reached Kansas City.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "images/IMG_0284.JPG" alt = "John and Hooch quench their thirst." height = 403.2 width = 302.4>

    <h2>St. Louis, MO</h2>
        <p>Finally, after eight days of travel our '96 Honda rolled back into town with everyone intact!</p>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/IMG_0289.JPG" alt = "Disembarking before a celebratory breakfast." height = 302.4 width = 302.4>
